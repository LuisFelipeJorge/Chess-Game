# Chess-Game
C # is a language that supports the computer science paradigm of Object Oriented Programming.
The language allows the programmer to use the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism to facilitate the process of developing solutions.
In this project I was able to see and put into practice the following themes:

I applied the abstraction encompassing the methods related to a class in itself, so that other classes could just reuse these features without having to worry about their details and implementations.

The encapsulation can be seen in the way the classes, their attributes and methods were built. The data definition is closed within the class and can only be changed by the functions defined within it, which keeps both protected from external interference and misuse.

Inheritance is a hierarchical relationship between classes that expresses the idea "is-a-type-of". In the design of the chess game, this was presented for example in the definition of a parent class 'Piece' and its child classes that contains the specifications for each component of the game.

Polymorphism means that we can have several derived classes that share the same method and properties, but implement them in different ways according to the context of each one. An example of this in my code is the way that each piece has its own implementation of movement that is defined by the characteristics of the chess game pieces.
